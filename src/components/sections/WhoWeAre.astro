      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Cub Scout Pack 151 is a family pack open to all kids Kindergarten through Fifth Grade. We are proud
        to welcome youth of every background and their families into our Scouting adventure.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We meet on Monday nights at 7:00 PM at Marple Presbyterian Church in Broomall and host monthly hikes,
        weekend outings, and family events year-round.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        For over 60 years, Pack 151 has been building confidence, leadership, and character in young people
        across Marple Newtown. Many of our Scouts go on to join Troop 151 right here in Broomall, continuing
        their growth toward Eagle Scout.
